Simple busfreq driver for the NXP i.MX8MM SoC:

This driver is a simpler variant of the much more complicated driver from NXP.
Compared to the complicated handling logic of the NXP driver, this driver only
switches to the low busfrequency when requested from userspace.

The current frequency settings are hardcoded to:


Required properties:

- compatible		: "sue,simple-busfreq-imx8mm"
- clocks		: Must contain the list clocks use to control the operation,
			  see the example below for the actual clocks.
- clock-names		: Matching clock names, see example below.

Example:

simple-busfreq {
	compatible = "sue,simple-busfreq-imx8mm";

	clocks = <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_NOC_DIV>,
		 <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_AHB_DIV>,
		 <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_MAIN_AXI_SRC>,
		 <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_24M>,
		 <&clk IMX8MM_SYS_PLL2_333M>;
	clock-names = "noc_div",
		      "ahb_div",
		      "main_axi_src",
		      "osc_24m",
		      "sys_pll2_333m";
};
