Stream195x ASoC card driver:

This driver is mainly intended to be used on Stream195x (i.MX8) based devices. Generally
the configuration is similar to `simple-card.txt`, however many features like DAMP and
jack detection are not implemented (yet). And some additional properties were added to
accommodate StreamUnlimited use cases.

Required properties:

- compatible				: "sue,stream195x-audio"
- sue-card,name				: User specified sound card name, one string
- clocks				: Must contain entries to two clocks, ideally different ones
					  which can generate a rate that divides down to audio frequencies.
- clock-names				: Must contain "pll8k" and "pll11k", the respective clock will
					  be chosen based on the requested sample rate. E.g. for 48 kHz, the
					  pll8k clock will be used and for 44.1 kHz the pll11k one will be
					  used.
- sue-card,dai-link			: Container for dai-link level properties and the CPU and CODEC
					  sub-nodes.


Optional properties:

- powerdown-gpios			: General GPIO used to control power pins of DACs, AMPs, etc.


Dai-link subnode properties and subnodes:

Required dai-link subnodes:

- format				: CPU/CODEC common audio format.
					  "i2s", "right_j", "left_j" , "dsp_a" "dsp_b", "ac97", "pdm", "msb", "lsb"
and at least one of:
- cpu					: CPU   sub-node
- codec					: CODEC sub-node

Optional dai-link subnode properties:

- frame-master				: Indicates dai-link frame master.  phandle to a cpu or codec subnode.
- bitclock-master			: Indicates dai-link bit clock master.  phandle to a cpu or codec subnode.
- bitclock-inversion			: bool property. Add this if the dai-link uses bit clock inversion.
- frame-inversion			: bool property. Add this if the dai-link uses frame clock inversion.
- continuous-clock			: bool property. Will set the SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CONT flag to not disable clocks.
- mute-gpios				: GPIO generally connected to the mute pin of the respective codec
- dai-tdm-slot-num			: Number of slots in use. (Channels)
- dai-tdm-slot-width			: Width in bits for each slot.

Required CPU/CODEC subnodes properties:

- sound-dai				: phandle and port of CPU/CODEC

NOTE: Only one of the above properties is required, if both are specified, the dummy codec takes precedence.


Example:

sound-pcm {
	compatible = "sue,stream195x-audio";
	sue-card,name = "Stream Audio on i.MX8MM";

	clocks = <&clk IMX8MM_AUDIO_PLL1_OUT>, <&clk IMX8MM_AUDIO_PLL2_OUT>;
	clock-names = "pll8k", "pll11k";

	powerdown-gpios = <&gpio1 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

	sue-card,dai-link@0 {
		format = "i2s";

		continuous-clock;

		frame-master = <&dailink0_cpu>;
		bitclock-master = <&dailink0_cpu>;

		mute-gpios = <&gpio1 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

		dailink0_cpu: cpu {
			sound-dai = <&sai5>;
			dai-tdm-slot-num = <2>;
			dai-tdm-slot-width = <32>;
		};
	};
};
